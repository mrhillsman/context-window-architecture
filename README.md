# Context Window Architecture

## Overview

[Provide a brief overview of your project here. Describe its purpose, goals, and any key features.]

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

*   **Python:** Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
*   **Dependencies:** Install any necessary project dependencies. You can typically do this by running:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    (If you don't have a `requirements.txt` file, you should create one!)
*   **Run prerequisite scripts:** Execute the following scripts located in the `prereqs` folder to set up necessary components:
    *   `python prereqs/setup_sqldb.py`
    *   `python prereqs/setup_vectordb.py`

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [URL_OF_YOUR_REPOSITORY]
    cd [REPOSITORY_NAME]
    ```
2.  **Set up a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Shoulders of Giants
Context Window Architecture would not be possible if not for all of the great research, development, and thought leadership of others. Please see [SHOULDERS.md](SHOULDERS.md) to see a list of them.
